# About

Hello, World! I am Paul Kim â€” a Senior Full stack Engineer with 15+ years of professional experience. I'm most comfortable in Typescript building with React.js and Node.js. I have a lot of startup experience and am very capable of wearing multiple hats and shipping products end-to-end.

It's fair to say I'm an expert when it comes to web3/blockchain technology, however I have had a strong interest in AI/ML for many years as well. I believe the future is in fully autonomous agents that will 100x our productivity, and in order to build out this future, it will require a deep understanding of both web3 and AI/ML.
